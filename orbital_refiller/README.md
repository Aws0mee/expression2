Lets your ncrp printers orbit around the chip and auto refills them.
To add a printer type ;add in the chat
Just look at the green square from where ever you want aslong as you look on the top of the square.

It also supports a user to collect the money of the printers, just connect a user over wirelink to the e2.


It currently doesnt really support alot of printers and is really unefficent. i will try to fix that.

Some useful chat commands:
- ;add
- ;remove
- ;reset
- ;config number Radius 50
- ;config number MaxRange 50

if the e2 is crashing because of tick quota exceed try lowering the MaxPerf config value.
