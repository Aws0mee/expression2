A place for a bunch of my e2 scripts

Use "Meow's Git Installer" to easily install *any github repo

dont expect good code nor english.

If you are using my scripts for ncrp i would always appreciate a small credit donation <3



*any supported github repo (the main file must be called main.txt and the e2 will only download .txt files)
